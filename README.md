Front end test:

The purpose of this test is to create a new interface using the Github API: https://developer.github.com/v3/
The application must contain a form where you can enter a Github username or organization.
Once the form is submitted, it returns the paginated list of public repository for this specific user or organization.
The results table must be paginated, sortable and filterable by all the options available on the API.
The code must be shared via a Github repository with a README explaining your choices.
For the purpose of this test you MUST use an MV* javascript framework (angularjs, emberjs, …).
You are also free to choose the CSS framework you prefer.
Don’t forget to write automated tests.

Bonus:
 * Make it available on Heroku.
